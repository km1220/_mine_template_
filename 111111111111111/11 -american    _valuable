### **I've generated over $10 million in sales for my clients**

Hi there,

Looks like you need a blockchain developer to help create an app that's suitable for your business model. Want to sidestep the unqualified people clogging your inbox?

I've generated over $10 million in sales for my clients and worked with executives at Fantom and XRP on their blockchain architecture.

I’ve been involved in blockchain development since 2017, coding since I was 17 (15 years), I'm a Director of DJS Tech Group, and I’m more passionate about crypto and blockchain than anyone you’ll meet.

If you’re looking for help, let’s hop on a quick call and discuss your needs.
I see that you're in [Netherlands]; you can book a meeting in your time zone with this link:

### **NFT, DeFi & Blockchain Architecture**

$97.00/hr
Looking for code that’s copy-pasted by an amateur and is full of security vulnerabilities?

Ya, didn’t think so.

Likely, you want an expert that's made over 10 million $ for his clients and has worked with executives at leading blockchains like XRP and Fantom.

Blockchain code is immutable (it can’t be changed). If you don’t get this part right, it will sink your entire project.

That’s why I’m here to help. I’ve been involved in blockchain development since 2017, coding for over 15 years, I'm a Director of DJS Tech Group, I speak 3 languages, and I’m so passionate about this space that I constantly annoy friends and family because I never stop talking about it.

Simply put, I’m an expert. So if you’re looking for someone to guide you through this world, give you fast and reliable deliveries (with full transparency), and make sense of all of the technical "jargon" for you, I’m your guy.

I've developed and launched millions of $ in NFT sales, worked with some of the brightest minds in the space.

If you’re serious about building a meaningful project (and makes serious money in the process), shoot me a message, and let’s schedule a call.

Please note :

I only want to work with people who are extremely committed. To me, this space plays an important role in the future and I'm very passionate about my role in developing that future.

I have the keys to help you with every single aspect of your project and make sure it's a smooth ride... But I can't help everyone.

If we decide to work together, you’ll be taken care of at the highest level. That’s my guarantee.

\*\* To help assist me with volume, I'll have my business associate, Jon, on the introductory call.
