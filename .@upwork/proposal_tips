Upwork Freelance Proposal Tips – Quick Review

1. Use the first line to show that you’ve read their profile and understand what they need (instead of saying your name and talking about yourself).

2. Introduce yourself and explain why you’re an expert in what they need.

3. Make a recommendation or ask a question to reinforce the fact that you’re an expert on this topic.

4. Close with a Call to Action to get them to reply. Either ask for a website to learn more, or ask them when they’re available to talk.

5. Sign off with your name.

6. Keep everything brief. Aim for less than 120 words in your Upwork proposal. 85-100 words is ideal.

7. Use great spacing; you should only have two to three sentences MAXIMUM per paragraph in your proposal.

8. Only send proposals for jobs posted on Upwork within the last 24 hours. You’ll be more likely to get the interview if you do this.

9. Commit to sending out proposals five days per week (Monday – Friday) for at least a month to build up your leads on Upwork.

10. Price yourself near the top of the client’s range. Never compete on price and never try to be the cheapest.

11. Make sure you have a great Upwork profile that backs up everything you’re saying in your Upwork proposal.
