Hi there,


This job post is a good opportunity for both you and me cause I was an instructor.
Looks like you need a tutor to help your improvement. Want to sidestep the unqualified people clogging your inbox?

I‚Äôve been involved in full-stack development since 2009, coding since I was 19, and I‚Äôm more passionate about MERN stack than anyone you‚Äôll meet.

If you‚Äôre looking for help, let‚Äôs hop on a quick call and discuss your needs.
I see that you're in America; you can book a meeting in your time zone with this link:

Hey James! Thank you for outlining your experience and answering the questions. From your responses, it sounds like you have excellent understanding of development and many technical skills. I would love to learn from you.

How about this as a starting point:
1. I hire you for this project on upwork
2. You develop a plan for PHASE 2 of the below phases
3. You share the plan overview with me and we get started

Phase 1: Setup
- Teach me how to setup the project with the full stack
- Teach me how to develop locally with FE/BE/DB without pushing code

Phase 2: Learning Code
- Where do we start? FE? BE? DB?
- This is your phase 100% here

Phase 3: Push to Production
- I'll get a domain through Route 53 as a sandbox website for my practice
- Let's setup repos and push the code to the live website
- I'd like to use all AWS products (route 53, S3, lambda's, etc.)
- Teach me how to manage pull requests and releases

Phase 4: Circle back to learning
- Dig deeper into learning code for the full stack
- I'll basically build a mock design for some app and build it for practice

Tech stack (I'm sure there is more):
- Frontend: React (I'm okay with either js or ts. I am most familiar with js.)
- Backend: Node
- Database: Mongo
- Whatever else you think?

What do you think? Should I hire you and we meet regarding phase 1?

Thank you for coming to me.
Of course, We'll work together.
First of all, I'll make a plan for you.

Let's start from Frontend: React,
You said you are most familiar with JS.
React is One of the web‚Äôs most popular frameworks for building JavaScript applications.
React has many innovative notions.

I'll finish my details of plan during weekend.
Do you want to discuss even during weekend?




Ben Petersen 2:10 AM
Aweasome! Looking forward to it.

Normally I am 100% open to weekends, but this weekend is a holiday weekend here in the U.S. and my wife and I will be camping in the mountains.

What is your typical hours that you are awake? I see that it is very late for you but yet you are still awake!!



James Hogan 2:18 AM
Thank you.
I have a habit to check mails before call a day.
In fact, I'm half asleep.
I hope you enjoy your weekend.

I'll contact to you again.
Please send me a message when you come back.



Ben Petersen 2:27 AM
Okay sounds good. Rest well and enjoy the weekend!

Ben. We'll work long time, maybe at least a few weeks.
And of course I've got several things to do and I can't stay in Upwork full-time.

What is your Skype?
My all fellow colleagues are in there.
So I want to involve you one of them üôÇ
This is really easy and cool to chat.
Let's meet via skype.




Ben Petersen 2:48 AM
I‚Äôm good with either Skype or Slack, you‚Äôre choice üòÄ

This is my skype handle

I will wait you on there .




Ben Petersen 2:49 AM
Okay I‚Äôll add you when I get back to the office!

I agree, upwork isn‚Äôt the best for actual chat/meeting ongoing.
