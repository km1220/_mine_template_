### **Netherlands : I built a lot of projects, **

Hey mede nederlander (i'm elite developer!?),

Having built over 30 blockchain projects worth over 20 million dollars, I invite you to take advantage of the process I’ve developed to efficiently produce high quality blockchain projects time after time.

Projects I have built:
☆ ERC-20 coins & offerings (reaching $100m+ marketcaps)
☆ NFT launches & offerings ($20m+ value raised)
☆ NFT utilities & ecosystems (staking, breeding, rarity, casino games)
☆ Metaverse (open world casino game)
☆ Decentralized finance (Flash Loans, Lending/Borrowing, OHM fork, DEX)
☆ Web3 Startup (watch-to-earn)

## Don’t believe me? Please go over the following projects I have delivered in the past year and see the results I have been able to generate:

☑ How we helped Slotie NFT launch their NFT collections and develop their NFT ecosystem, raising 10M$ in the process.

☑ How we helped Metatriads launch their NFT collection, $Tria token and staking portal, raising 1M$ in the process.

☑ How we helped Crypto Bull Society sell out 1111 Crypto Bears in less than one hour, generating $700K revenue in the process. (https://doc.clickup.com/24424452/d/h/q9c04-2147/aa2b1fc381832b4)

Besides the case studies, I encourage you to check my profile to learn more about me.

Your project interests me because I specialize in blockchain and smart contract development. By utilizing my experience in smart contract development and knowledge of the crypto space we can create a reliable, secure and bug free blockchain application.

I invite you to schedule a free consultation call with me, where we will create a more in-depth overview of how to implement your desired application using blockchain technology. If we are suitable partners to work together, we can move forward with the next steps directly on the call. Otherwise you can take the information provided to another party and use it as you wish.

Please message me three time/day periods which would suit you to do a one hour call with me. From these three periods I will choose one and send you a zoom link on that day.

Thank you,
[Karim]
