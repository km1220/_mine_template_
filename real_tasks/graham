hi

Kevin Mark 11:40 PM
Hi

Nice to meet you!

Graham Bates 11:40 PM
Yes and you!

Have you worked with Cognito before?

hopefully the job spec describes what is required

Kevin Mark 11:41 PM
Of course. I did.

Could you send me the docs?

Hi?

Are you there?

Graham Bates 11:42 PM
How do you mean the docs?

Kevin Mark 11:42 PM
I mean the specs.

Graham Bates 11:43 PM
I need an example of how to , from a front end, authenticate against the following



https://github.com/jagregory/cognito-local#updating-your-application

GitHub
GitHub - jagregory/cognito-local: Local emulator for Amazon Cognito
Local emulator for Amazon Cognito. Contribute to jagregory/cognito-local development by creating an account on GitHub.
So all that would be required would be a simple create react app using amplify or similar, to send a user name and password, that authenticates against that local server

it requires some over rides to tell it to connect to a local cognito, not the cloud

Kevin Mark 11:46 PM
I can see what you mean.

OK

I can do you.

I want to ask something.

Graham Bates 11:47 PM
sure

have you used this lib before?

cognito-local

Kevin Mark 11:48 PM
Yes.
and this is a test project?

Graham Bates 11:48 PM
yes

Kevin Mark 11:48 PM
You just want to connect to local, it that all?

You are a developer?

Graham Bates 11:49 PM
yup! just a login screen that auths against local instead of my aws cognito

yes

Kevin Mark 11:49 PM
OK, I think we can be a good friend.

Maybe we can collaborate for long time.

Graham Bates 11:50 PM

Kevin Mark 11:50 PM
