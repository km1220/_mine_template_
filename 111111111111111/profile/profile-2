MERN stack & Blockchain Expert





Hi.
I'm a web/mobile developer with 10+ years of background in software development and 5 years of experience in blockchain development.
As a full-stack and blockchain developer, I have been working with Angular, React, Vue and Node.js as well as Typescript. Especially, React is my main skills and I mastered all features of React such as React, Next.js for SSR and SSG, Hook functions, Saga, Thunk, state management and many UI frameworks such as MUI, Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. I always focus on the pixel-perfect and responsive design in my frontend job and I am very proficient with React frontned UI projects.

And also, I developed many MERN stack projects so I have deep knowledge about backend with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB with RESTful APIs and GraphQL. Recently, I focus on blockchain project about NFT, Defi, DEX, Arbitrage with flash loan bot and cryptos with my rich experience in React and Node.js.
Of course, I mastered Solidity Smart Contract for NFT minting, staking, marketplace, Defi and DEX.

Therefore, I can do any type of projects you have and I will give you 100% satisfaction in a very short time.
Hope work with you.
