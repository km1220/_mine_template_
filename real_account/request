Hi
As a senior developer,
I have over 13 years of development experience 
and  about 8k$ per month. 

So far, I have only worked in the Asian market. 
Recently, I found that American Jobs are so expensive than Asian Jobs, and I was interested in this and tried to find a American job. 
But unfortunately, my English was poor and due to various problems, 

I couldn't get a American job. American clients were looking for someone who could speak English like a native. 
So, I am looking for someone who can work with me to help me find a job. 
If you help me solve these problems, I can get a American job and earn more money. 
And if we get a job, I'll give you 10% of the profits.
Thanks
