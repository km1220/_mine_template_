Hi!
Truth be told, I'm new at Upwork.
But till now, I've developed 30+ projects with my team  -  DJS Thech Group.
While I'm handling the front-end, the rest of my team are moving mountains of product development.ðŸ˜€

Here are my relevant works:
-----------------------------------
https://foodkarma.ae/
https://www.enmassenergy.com/
https://www.mrdraper.com/

And lastly, I describe exactly the reasons why you should go with me, over someone else.
Till now, we've developed in outside of Upwork.
We decided to dive into Upwork recently, but I'm new at it.
I know how much does the success of first project is important for my profile.
So I'll do all of my best for you if we work together.

âš¡ Don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm ready to burn ðŸ”¥

Kind Regards,
Kevin.
