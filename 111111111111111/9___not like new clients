### **Not like new Client but recently finished similar project**

Hello!
Usually, I don’t look for new clients but I’ve recently finished a similar project like yours so your post took my attention.

One of my recent client says: 👇
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

> "[ Kevin / James] & his TEAM is a real asset to the project - often on Upwork when you hire an engineer full-time you taking a lot of risk - a freelancer might ghost you and for some reason, it happens at the most important parts of the project, might not have proper communication, might be outsourcing the work to someone else, at the end of the day he just might not write good code and not be efficient in what he does - worst-case scenario if he’s not tracking time properly & work just to bill you hours. With [ Kevin / James] we had no issues like that - the process he uses is awesome - daily stand-ups, regular check-ins, all-time clear communication, a separate tracking system that checks the activity & the tasks delivered is awesome - a new level of experience in comparison to everyone I’ve worked with so far."

Surely you’re looking for someone reliable, who can be with you all the time, have clear communication, someone who knows the industry & development very well & can consult with you on implementations & security issues.

Maybe this will be a perfect fit for us. I expect people to give business their all, and I return the favor. If you’re truly passionate about this, let’s hop on a call.

And lastly, I describe exactly the reasons why you should go with me, over someone else.
Till now, we've developed in outside of Upwork.
We decided to dive into Upwork recently, but I'm new at it.
I know how much does the success of first project is important for my profile.
So I'll do all of my best.

Reply to this message to set up a time to chat.

Kind Regards,
[ Kevin / James].
