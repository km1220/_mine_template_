first repository yolo-v7 is a project to detect human and track using kalman filter.


It's developed to overcome occlusion issue


the second project "Sensor Based Motion Detect" is developed to predict human motion based on Mobile device sensor data


the app gathers sensor data available on the phone such as Motion sensors - acceleration, rotation, geolocation, etc, and other sensors - distance from human and device, temperature,...


the final result is the motion types.


And third repository - farcast is developed to predict stock price.


It forecasts stock prices using ARIMA, SSA, LSTM.


All forecast methds are implemented on the project.



And I'm working on a project - AR


It detect target from realtime video stream, calculate camera calibration, and render 3d object on the target place.


When camera calib data is changed, the rendered object is synchronized


so that it's showed as if it's in the real world.


To be honestly, ML/DL fields are too hudge,


I want to know what kind of AI stack do you need
