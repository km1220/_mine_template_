Rescue project is no big deal for me cause I've experienced many times like yours!
Most important point is we can collaborate further more time.
I hope so.



Hi bro.
Nice to meet to you.



After reading your post, I realized something.
So I would like to advise you.



Indian developers are high school graduates almost everyone.
Thus their code quality is low and this fact is so tragedy.



Of course, there are experts of them, but I think you hired not experts.



Anyway, I can help you.
I pay attention for not only project itself but also client's success.



You can count on me enough.
Let's hop a call first.
Cheers.
James

Hi James, I agree with you advise totally, unfortunately I already hired an Indian Vendor , I think are good but someone strong needs to manage them properly and they can deliver.
Secondly we can get on a call not a problem, However the rate $60 is very high, I am setting up startup and have limited budget $1000 a month fix until I get funding which will happen after product is ready and I got out selling it : )

James Hogan 6:34 AM
Ok

This can be our first collaboration.
I wish we can work for long time.

I want not only money but also a good relationship with you.

So I can follow your budget.

Let's discuss more details.
