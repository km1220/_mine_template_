I am looking to create narrative design software. 
There are several angles to this. 
It will allow you to create the narrative world and label everything out, similar to how World Anvil and Campfire Writing do, the characters, using a lot of tropes found through personality types, birth order, date of birth, and actions, and the story by organizing the acts, segments, scenes, and beats. 
All of this information will be recorded and prompted so that as you type, a content generator created from all the content online as well as the organization and details you write, will help you write out your narrative.

This will need to allow book, comic, screenplay, or game design formatting. 
I would love to add a way to create DnD campaigns, musical lyrics, short stories, and tv shows as well.
Next, I need an A.I. image generation software. 
These are new, but I also know you can draw really poorly and it creates a beautiful image for it.

I would love to also add the lip-syncing feature and see if we can have the art animated as well.


I would also love to see A.I.-generated music as well as public domain music and sound effects. 
I need the art, writing, and sound to all integrate together. 
I would also love to create choose-your-own-adventure features with choices and stats, as well as the ability to add some random elements, just as you would have in a video game or DnD campaign. 
We can discuss the details later but I need the best price on this project, however quality and speed are a higher priority for me. 
Give me your best price and timeline and we can work out the details as we go. 
Any writing experience or understanding narrative structure is a plus.

I am willing to hire individuals, teams, or craft a team of my own so let me know your exact thoughts and we can consider adding you to the team, even if you specialize or can only do one part.
