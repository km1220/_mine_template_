Hey James,



Here is some information



EXAMPLES:



Here's a link to someone else doing what I am looking for (they didn't want to help, I asked)

Here's a link to someone doing what I'm looking for in Fusion 360. Although Fusion360 is a parametric modeling program, Rhino is capable of doing something similar using Python

Here is a free 2D online version of what I am essentially looking for... I do a few things different however

HOW I DRAW THEM NOW:



Here's a link to an online form that I have clients fill out. You can see how many variables there are when it comes to drawing them. This is for a "standard" Fingerboard

Here is how I draw them now with the information in the form above

Here's a link to our online form for a multiscale fingerboard. Similar process with a few more variables.

Here is how I draw a multiscale fingerboard with the information in the form above

HOW SCALE LENGTH WORKS:



Here is a video showing how the Scale Length actually SCALES and doesn't need manual entry for each coordinate

Here is a link to a site showing the actual formal used to create the fret placement of a scale length. The "Scaling" example above is much easier, however. We use the Modern Rule of 17.817 to get our placements

Here's another widely used and accepted Scale Length Calculator

Sorry for the info Bomb! Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in or if you know anyone who would be interested



Thanks
