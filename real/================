Hello.
Nice to meet you.

I've been working as a senior professional developer for over 10 years.
Meanwhile I've worked with many lots of techs and also achieved many wide range skills.

My main skill is MERN stack development but I'm strong at Svelte, Golang, ..., etc too.
Also strong at DevOps Engineering.
I've worked with great teams many times, and know how much the teamwork is important in development.
And I've got really high experiences so I have can-do-anything attitude.
I love to learn new techs and also I'm very passionate once I start working.

Anyway developement part is no big deal for me.
(I've done many remote jobs so I can work on any of your timezone)
You can count on me enough.

I would love to hop a call to discuss details.
Please touch me when you're free.
I'll wait for you.
Best regards.
