### **new but with team**

Hi!
Truth be told, I'm new at Upwork.
But till now, I've developed 70+ projects with my team - DJS Thech Group.
While I'm handling the front-end, the rest of my team are moving mountains of product development.ðŸ˜€

Here are my relevant works:

And lastly, I describe exactly the reasons why you should go with me, over someone else.
Till now, we've developed in outside of Upwork.
We decided to dive into Upwork recently, but I'm new at it.
I know how much the first project is important for my profile.
Your feedback is very important for my profile indeed.
So I'll do all of my best for you if we work together.

# _Director of DJS_

===================================================================

## **Professional**

### **High quality full-cycle custom Software Development**

Hi, I am the Director of DJS Tech Group, a professional software development company.
I have extremely rigorous and intense software development experiences since 2010.
Since then, Iâ€™ve been providing modern technology solutions helping businesses from several countries facilitate their product and process digital transformation. My mission is to help our clients achieve their goals by leveraging the latest tech. I help create a tech vision of the would-be solution and ramp up an engineering team with the skill set and experience in the appropriate tech stack.

1. Tech Focus
   We have a strong focus on DevOps and very familiar with Azure DevOps. We use various technologies for development.

2. Expertise
   We have the strongest expertise in business process automation (such as CRM, inventory management, eProcurement, booking, payment integrations, etc.), Business Intelligence / ETL / analytics software development, microservice architecture engineering, and legacy software modernization.

Most of our clients come from fintech, insurance, real estate and manufacturing industries. For them we build full-fledged enterprise-level software and test out new ideas with PoCs and MVPs. We also contribute to SaaS product development initiatives of our clients helping them overcome the typical technical challenges, including third-party systems integrations, subscription lifecycle management, zero downtime deployment and more.

We have already delivered 100+ projects. This hands-on experience allows us to come up with more cost-efficient and reliable solutions, than the competition with less subject-matter expertise.

Being an engineer myself and a practicing developer with 1)+ years of experience in DevOps. I can help you DevOps tasks as well:

- Deployment of the release delivered by the developers in production;
- Integration and deepening of development processes in the supply;
- Standardization of development environment;
- Setting the infrastructure for the features of the developed software;
- Preparing the production environment for frequent changes;
- Detection and correction of problems;
- Automatization of processes.

> As a business owner, I strongly focus on delivering top-quality service to our clients. We are interested in your projectâ€™s success just as much as you are. To achieve this goal we are continuously fine-tuning our processes, streamlining communication, and applying the most efficient agile software development and project management techniques. Our developers speak fluent English, offer flexible working hours, and invest in their self-education and professional growth which is part of our corporate culture.

If you have an idea that requires implementation, if your current dev initiative is stalled or if you are looking to replace outdated software - youâ€™ve come to the right place. My team and I are at your service. We have experience both in development from scratch and project rescue. We can work both as a standalone engineering team developing a solution end to end, or in a collaboration with the clientâ€™s in-house team.

> Letâ€™s set up a call to discuss your pains and plans and see how we can help. Once I get a better understanding of your situation, I will provide a free quote for the solution.

Feel free to message me,
James.
