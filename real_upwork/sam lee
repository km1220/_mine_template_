James Hogan 8:04 PM
OK meanwhile could you explain me about your project?

SL
Sam Lee 8:04 PM
As said, it is an existing project

but require some content update

and update UA to GA4

https://nuclearenergy.clpgroup.com

Nuclear Energy | CLP Group
A Sustainable Choice for Powering the Future
this is the website

however, the original development company is closed, so we are picking it up for this content update

James Hogan 8:05 PM
oh, I can see

SL
Sam Lee 8:06 PM
the challenge is not in the scope itself. the content change is only changing some wording and some hyperlink

the challenge is to understand the source code as it is composed by vue.js frontend and a c# api

James Hogan 8:07 PM
I'm checking your site and seems pretty clear

SL
Sam Lee 8:07 PM
but with your skill, I think you will be able to handle that

yes

this is the scope document

NuclearWebsite_Function Specifivcation.0.1.docx

it is a very defined project, not going to have any ad-hoc changes or anything like that

we just need to hire a developer who are good at both vue.js and c# to complete the work

James Hogan 8:08 PM
no problem

that's my major skills

SL
Sam Lee 8:08 PM
that's why we hand picked you because of your skill

anyway

once we have the call and show you the setup, if you are ok, then we can start the work instantly

are you available for work?

James Hogan 8:09 PM
yes

I think we can collaborate further more for long time

SL
Sam Lee 8:09 PM
james

you know what

James Hogan 8:09 PM
I would like to make a good relationship with you

SL
Sam Lee 8:10 PM
this is exactly what I think

CLP << this is the cusotmer

we have a lot of project from this customer

James Hogan 8:10 PM
awesome!

looking forward to it!

SL
Sam Lee 8:10 PM
so, if you are good, we will have another project together early next year on this exact same website

which include upgrading the vuejs version as well as some of the dependency used

James Hogan 8:10 PM
I've just finished a long term project and was looking for another one

SL
Sam Lee 8:11 PM
great

James Hogan 8:11 PM
perfect

SL
Sam Lee 8:11 PM
we can use this one as a trial

James Hogan 8:11 PM
