Hello . You need a developer to create a website ? I think you have found the expert you were looking for. And I can propose some site for you, like this : https://kit2022.oski.site/ . It`s can be the site with design, with hosting and domain on UMBRACO CMS .
But I need some information:
1) Have you already chosen a domain, hosting?
2) How many pages should a site have?
3) What is the functionality of each of the pages?
4) How many blocks of information should be on the pages?
5) Can you send the links with sample sites you like?
I have good experience in similar projects for different companies with Umbraco. I have a company https://oski.site/ which is specialized on Umbraco support and development. We did a lot of upgrades and lead them to success in all cases. I understand what you need and I would be happy to bring it to life. You want to have something like this : https://www.klinger.dk ? , or this : https://www.itwcp.co.uk/en .

My experience in web development is 8 years. Comfortable with software like C#, Umbraco, Angular, JavaScript, SQL, React, .NET Cor3 and graphic design tools. Iâ€™m able to help you with all things you need and I would be happy to create something really unique, fresh and attractive for you .
