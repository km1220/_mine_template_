================================================
Hi
I'm a passionate proactive developer, and an AI engineer.
I've done many projects for my clients and have vast experiences in many fields.

I love to learn new things especially the newest, innovative techs and tried to learn almost all of the original ideas/notions.
Now I have a can-do-anything attitude based on my skills and experiences.

I pay attention to not only the quality of the result, but also the success of my client's business and strive to establish a good relationship with them.

Please feel free to message.
I would love to succeed with you.
Thank you for your consideration, Joseph
