Hello!
Usually, I don’t look for new clients but I’ve recently finished a similar project like yours so your post took my attention.
And I'm new at Upwork too because until now, I've worked only with my team - DJS Thech Group.   Not individual.

If you want a professional team, my team can be a good choice.

One of my recent client says: 👇
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

> "James & his TEAM is a real asset to the project - often on Upwork when you hire an engineer full-time you taking a lot of risk - a freelancer might ghost you and for some reason, it happens at the most important parts of the project, might not have proper communication, might be outsourcing the work to someone else, at the end of the day he just might not write good code and not be efficient in what he does - worst-case scenario if he’s not tracking time properly & work just to bill you hours. With James we had no issues like that - the process he uses is awesome - daily stand-ups, regular check-ins, all-time clear communication, a separate tracking system that checks the activity & the tasks delivered is awesome - a new level of experience in comparison to everyone I’ve worked with so far."

Surely you’re looking for someone reliable, who can be with you all the time, have clear communication, someone who knows the industry & development very well & can consult with you on implementations & security issues.

Maybe this will be a perfect fit for us. I expect people to give business their all, and I return the favor. If you’re truly passionate about this, let’s hop on a call.

And lastly, I describe exactly the reasons why you should go with me, over someone else.
Till now, we've developed in outside of Upwork.
We decided to dive into Upwork recently, but I'm new at it.
I know how much does the success of first project is important for my profile.
So I'll do all of my best.

Reply to this message to set up a time to chat.

Kind Regards,
James.

I've got high experience both CMS and Full Stack development.
Wordpress is good and easy enough for building and managing the structure.
But if your project gets bigger, the most critical weakness is speed.

Of course, I can do this for you, perfectly & satisfactorily
         but if I were you, I'll build a Full Stack application instead.
         It's more smart, faster, and good for responsive too.
This is just my opinion but maybe you can count on it.

Anyway, let's hop a call first to discuss details.
Cheers.

Hi
I apply you twice and this costs double connects.
I propose you twice cause I'm very suitable and can handle your task successfully.


I'm pretty sure I'm the most suitable candidate than anyone else you'll meet for met.
OK, I can see what you want exactly.

Let's start to discuss right now!


If you want to see my previous projects, I can show you lots of them.
So let's contact first to discuss details.
Best Regards.


First thing is first.
Let's hop a call to discuss.


Many a lot.
React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Next, Nuxt, Nest, Gatsby,....
Node/Express, PHP, Golang, ASP.NET, Python/Django, Ruby on Rails, ...
You can check on my github profile  (readme file).

I have used many test tools but can't exactly say which one is best.
Personally I prefer to use Jest.


And one thing I want to suggest you is
        why do you want to use PHP?
         I recommend you to use node or golang for backend.
These are much better than PHP.


If you want something, just name it, then you've got it.
If you show me your vision, I will show you the future.
If you have a dream, I will make it real.

===========================================================================

Why are you looking for Indian developers?
What I suggest you is most of them are high school graduations,
    and the quality of their results are pretty low.
Of course, some of them are experts but most of them are not.
They don't have a understanding about engineering and architecture.
So once you manage to finish, there'll be other potential error while maintaining.

Anyway, if you want a successful result,
    please touch me when you're free.

Best regards.
