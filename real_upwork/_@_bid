=== Hi ===
I read your post carefully.
Your posting is giving me strong motivation cause it's exactly my major.
 
I would like to ask some questions:
Do you have any detailed plan to implement it?
Or you want me to suggest it to you?
Do you have a design like figma? Or even sketch design?
Do you have any idea what framework to use for your project?
When do you have time to discuss details with me?
 
Hope to hear from you soon.
James H
