Hi

As a AI engineer and senior software developer, I have been working about about 7 years by tracking successful record..
I have rich experiences in wide ranges of tech skills and have done many projects.

In addition, major is Web, Mobile and Game development as well as integrating AI algorithms, ML/DL.
I built many websites using various tech stacks and have deep knowledge about web infrastructure, believe I can do anything based on my experiences.
I really love to learn/studying new things, especially innovative techs and original ideas.
This attitude is one of the factors I'm now.

I hope to find a new opportunity to grow my career by collaborating successfully with right client.
If you care about the quality and high speed implementation rather than cheapness, 
I can be your right guy.

I pay attention on not only the quality of project result, but also the success of client's business.
If you show me the vision, I'll show you the vision.
Please don't hesitate to message me if you have anything to do.
Thanks for you reading.
Best, thanks.
