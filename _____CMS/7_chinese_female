WordPress Fanatic | Speed Optimization | Conversion Rate Optimization

=======================================================
I LOVE working with WordPress. In fact, I work 8 hours a day on WordPress projects.

I have the capability to create WordPress websites that not only LOOK GOOD, but also CONVERT. That's very important, because a website that does not convert is meaningless. I study a lot of online marketing especially Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), and I like to apply the theories to the websites I create.

I also hate slow-loading sites! Call me a page speed specialist if you would, as I've helped more than 600 WordPress websites with page loading speed. Fast website = happy visitors = high CRO!

I am fluent in using design frameworks such as Divi and Visual Composer. I have extensive experience setting up WooCommerce stores. I am also fluent in Photoshop and graphic designing.

In short, when you hire me, you are getting a world-class, modern-looking WordPress website that helps you achieve your business objective.
